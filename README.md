# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview
In this project I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and designed a web app to accommodate these images. View a screenshot of the final web app below.<br>
